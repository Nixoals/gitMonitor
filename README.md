# GitMonitor
---

## Local app:
This project is a small  React app to retrieve, resolve or reopen incidents based on the GitGuardian API.

---

To run the project locally start the server with npm command:
```
npm install && npx nodemon index.js
```
and the client react app:
````
yarn && yarn start
````
 
 Once the app is running, you can use your gitGuardian API key in the field 'GGSHIELD API KEY' to display your public or private sources from github, gitlab, bitbucket ... and resolve incidents.


## Live app:
You can also use it online [here](https://cool-starship-4e955a.netlify.app)
